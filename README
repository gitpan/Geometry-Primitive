Geometry::Primitive - Primitive Geometry Entities

Geometry::Primitive is a device and library agnostic system for representing
geometric entities such as points, lines and shapes.  It provides simple
objects and many convenience methods you would expect from a simple geometry
library.

    use Geometry::Primitive::Point;

    my $foo = Geometry::Primitive::Point->new(x => 1, y => 3);
    ...
