=head1 NAME

Geometry::Primitive - Primitive Geometry Entities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Geometry::Primitive is a device and library agnostic system for representing
geometric entities such as points, lines and shapes.  It provides simple
objects and many convenience methods you would expect from a simple geometry
library.

    use Geometry::Primitive::Point;

    my $foo = Geometry::Primitive::Point->new(x => 1, y => 3);
    ...

=head1 DISCLAIMER

I'm not a math guy. I hate math. I will likely learn a lot in the process
of making this library. If you are a math person you will probably look at
this and find many things missing or wrong. Patches are B<encouraged>. I will
likely find that I've done something completely wrong having taken geometry
over 10 years ago.  C'est la vie.

=head1 SERIALIZATON

All of the entities in this library support serialization via
L<MooseX::Storage>.  This is primarily to support serialization in consumers
of this library, but may be useful for other purposes.  All classes are set
to JSON format and File IO.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Many of the ideas here come from my experience using the Cairo library.
