=head1 NAME

Geometry::Primitive::Bezier - Cubic Bézier Curve

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geometry::Primitive::Bezier represents a cubic Bézier curve.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Geometry::Primitive::Bezier;

  my $line = Geometry::Primitive::Bezier->new(
      start => $point1,
      control1 => $point2,
      control2 => $point3,
      end => $point4
  );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Creates a new Geometry::Primitive::Bezier

=head2 control1

Set/Get the first control point of the curve.

=head2 control2

Set/Get the second control point of the curve.

=head2 end

Set/Get the end point of the curve.

=head2 grow

Does nothing, as I'm not sure how.  Patches or hints welcome.

=head2 point_end

Get the end point.  Provided for Shape role.

=head2 point_start

Get the start point.  Provided for Shape role.

=head2 scale

Scales this curve by the amount provided.  Multiplies each coordinate by the
amount.

=head2 start

Set/Get the start point of the line.

=head2 to_string

Guess!
