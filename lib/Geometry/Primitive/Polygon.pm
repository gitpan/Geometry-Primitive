=head1 NAME

Geometry::Primitive::Polygon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Geometry::Primitive::Polygon represents a two dimensional figure bounded by a
series of points that represent a closed path.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Geometry::Primitive::Polygon;

  my $poly = Geometry::Primitive::Polygon->new();
  $poly->add_point($point1);
  $poly->add_point($point2);
  $poly->add_point($point3);
  # No need to close the path, it's handled automatically

=head1 METHODS
